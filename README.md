# Rideshare Analysis

## Overview

A ride share company, PyBer, has requested an analysis on the correlation between types of cities (urban, suburban, rural) versus ride volume and fare amounts. Findings in this report my drive decision-making by the company going forward.

## Results

Results of this report indicate the major impact of city type on ride volume and fare amount. From the data sets provided, the following information was derived:

From this summary of the data, we can draw some conclusions about how city type may affect ride volume and fare revenue.

### Ride Volume and City Type

The data provided clearly indicates a positive correlation between population size and the number of rides in each city; the greater the city's population, the greater the number of rides. While total rides in rural populations reach 125 rides for every 78 drivers, rides in urban areas reach 1,625 rides for every 2,405 drivers. Suburban rides and drivers fall somewhere in between each range, respectively.

An interesting takeaway from this particular information is not just the correlation between city size and ride volume, but that between city size and the number of drivers available to provide each ride. In rural and suburban settings, the number of rides requested outweigh the number of drivers available, meaning many drivers in rural and suburban cities must take on multiple rides in order to meet demand. In urban settings, however, the number of drivers outweight the number of rides, meaning urban drivers must compete with one another in order to provide rides.

### Fare Revenue and City Type

The ride share data also gives us some insight into the potential impact of city type on fare revenue. We can see that as population size increases with each city type, so does total revenue. This makes sense because of the contrast in the sheer volume of rides provided between city types. In looking at the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, we can see that the cost of a ride decreases as the population size increases, indicating a negative correlation between population size and fare amounts.

We also see that in rural and suburban cities, drivers on average accrue more revenue per ride than the average fare is worth; in urban cities, we see that drivers on average accrue less revenue per ride than the average fare is worth. This once again highlights the differences in supply and demand that we previously addressed; as population increases, so does the supply of drivers and demand for rides, while the cost of rides drops. 

Finally, we can draw some conclusions about how each city type performs over the course of the first four months of the calendar year:

The above graphic plots fares for each type of city throughout the first four months of 2019. Again, we see that revenue generated in rural cities is less than in suburban cities, which is less than in urban cities. Each indicator provides different insight for each city type. In rural cities, fare revenue increases steadily throughout the spring, with minor peaks and troughs and the highest fares peaking in April. In suburban cities, a bit more volatility leads to a peak in late February and dip in early April. in urban cities, late February and early march indicate surge times as fare fluctuate throughout the remaining months.

## Summary

The clearest takeaway from this data is the increase in ride volume and fare revenue with the increase of population per city. While a single company may not be able to manipulate the forces of supply and demand, it may opt to make driving in rural and suburban areas more attractive to potential drivers, who bring in more revenue on average than city drivers. In contrast, it might advertise its services to attract even more riders in urban areas, particularly in early spring, as riders are looking to spend more time on the town as the weather improves. Any The company should capitalize on any times during which ther is a surge in demand by responding with a surge in fares in order to generate more revenue.
